## 🚀 Features

- **Overview Dashboard**: High-level metrics on posts, authors, and sentiment trends.
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate social media spikes with real-world events to understand external triggers.
- **Narrative Analysis**: Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover hidden themes.
- **Network Visualization**: Interactive force-directed graph showing relationships between authors and domains.
- **Analyst Copilot**: An AI-powered chat interface to query top sources, analyze specific domains, and search for trends.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER-based sentiment scoring for all posts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts, React Force Graph
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **Data Processing**: Python 3.x
- **Analysis Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn (Topic Modeling), vaderSentiment (Sentiment), NetworkX (Graph Theory)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd research-engineering-intern-assignment
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the UI directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd my-data-ui
npm install
```

### 3. Python Environment Setup
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for the data processing scripts.

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Data Pipeline

The dashboard relies on pre-computed JSON data generated by the Python script. This ensures the frontend remains fast and responsive.

1. Ensure your raw data is located at `my-data-ui/public/data.json` (or ensure the script points to the correct source).
2. Run the analysis script:

```bash
# From the my-data-ui directory
python scripts/precompute_analysis.py
```

This command will generate the following files in `public/precomputed/`:
- `overview.json`
- `topics.json`
- `network.json`
- `sentiment.json`
- `event_correlations.json`

> **Note:** If you deploy this application, ensure these generated files are committed to your repository, as the Python script does not run in the browser.

## 🖥️ Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
# Inside my-data-ui directory
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 📦 Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the static assets. You can preview the production build locally using:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code (including `public/precomputed` files) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2. **Connect to Vercel**: Import the project.
3. **Settings**:
   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
4. **Deploy**: Click deploy and your dashboard will be live!

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
